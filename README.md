# getdomainszonelist
Few very simple lines of PHP code that provide a full list of internet domain zones(com, net, org, etc).

Source data I grab from <a href='https://domains-monitor.com/domainzones/'>https://domains-monitor.com/domainzones/</a>, as it provide most complete list of Internet domain zones. More than 1500 zones with daily updates
